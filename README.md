High Card

High card is 2 player game in which players take turns comparing cards drawn from a standard 52 card deck.

This program was developed with C# in Visual Studio 2017. Clone the repo, run the build as normal and follow the on-screen instructions.

My version of the game runs off the assumption that the cards follow the heirarchy: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10-2 in that order as well as: Diamond, Club, Heart, Spade for the suits in the event of a card tie.

On start, the players are asked if they would like the game to run automatically, which will play each turn to completion after starting the game. This can be turned off, allowing players to press the Enter key to progress for a more intimate game setting.

The player who draws the higher ranked card earns a point and the game is completed when each card from the deck has been drawn. After the winner is declared, The players have the option to rematch by typing yes/y.
